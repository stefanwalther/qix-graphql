## Motivation

This **prototype** is following the idea of bringing the concept of [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) together with the powerful Qlik Associative Engine (formerly also called QIX).

## Features

The prototype right now covers two different (complementary) scenarios:

- Getting information about one environment (e.g. listing all Qlik apps, etc.)
- Connecting to a single Qlik app working with this app, such as
  - Getting the data from an app
  - Being able to query the various tables & fields
  - Making selections
  - Creating on demand hypercubes
  - etc.
