I have split the work in a few iterations:

- **Iteration 1: Core prototyping work** **_<== !!! Sorry to say: WE ARE HERE !!!_**
  - Focus on core functionality
  - Testing various ideas/concepts
  - No UI work
  - Little documentation
  - Messy code ;-)
- **Iteration 2: Some work on enhanced concepts**
  - JWT support / Section Access
  - Using multiple engines, using mira 
- **Iteration 3: Getting to a first clean version**
  - Cleaning up / refactoring
  - Automated tests
- **Iteration 4: Clean UI & additional functionality**
