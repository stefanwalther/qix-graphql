The work has been split into a few iterations:

- **[Iteration 1: Core prototyping work](https://github.com/stefanwalther/qix-graphql/projects/2)** **_<== !!! Sorry to say: WE ARE HERE !!!_**
  - Focus on core functionality
  - Testing various ideas/concepts
  - No UI work
  - Little documentation
  - Sometimes Messy code ;-)
  - Unstable APIs
- **[Iteration 2: Some work on enhanced concepts](https://github.com/stefanwalther/qix-graphql/projects/3)**
  - JWT support / Section Access
  - Using multiple engines, using mira 
  - Using in Qlik Sense Multi Cloud
- **Iteration 3: Clean UI & additional functionality**
