_qix-graphql_ provides a [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) server sitting on top of the powerful Qlik Associative Engine (a.k.a. QIX Engine), regardless whether it is Qlik Sense Enterprise, a solution build with [Qlik Core](https://qlikcore.com/) or Qlik Sense Multi Cloud.

Using GraphQL next to QIX provides a completely new experience how to develop custom solutions:

- Use the powerful tooling from the [GraphQL community](https://github.com/chentsulin/awesome-graphql), such as [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql).
- Connect to Qlik environments and Qlik apps in most of the major programming languages, such as C#, Go, Java, JavaScript, Swift, Python, always with the same experience.
- There is no need anymore to understand Qlik specific constructs such as qHyperCube, SessionObjects, etc., just use GraphQL.
- Leverage the benefits of a strongly typed system (e.g in IDEs such as Visual Studio Code).
