# node.js Example

This examples proves the ussage of the _qix-graphql_ server using node.js.  
Not a big deal actually, you could achieve the same with enigma.js, too, just with a bit more code probably.

## Run the example

- cd into `./examples/node-js`
- run `npm install`
- start the dependencies by running `npm run up-server`
- run `npm run start`
